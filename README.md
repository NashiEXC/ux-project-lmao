start from the html file in the folder labelled main page 

group project done for year 1 semester 1 ux assignment, expect crappy html css and javascript all that jazz

text blurbs in the main page was written by ai because it was 5am, i was running on fumes and there was a looming deadline. outside of that there should be very little if not no AI-generated code. (we like doing things ourselves)

crunched out in 3 days because i have bad time management

~215mb in size
