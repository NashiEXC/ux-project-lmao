       <p>The fighting game genre involves combat between characters, often one-on-one battles. 
        The mechanics of combat often features blocking, grappling, counter-attacking, and the ability to chain attacks together into "combos".
          Battles are usually set in a fixed-size arena along a two-dimensional plane,
           where characters navigate horizontally by walking or dashing, and vertically by jumping.
